# TranscriptGPT:
This is a Firefox browser extension that allows you to copy out raw text transcripts from ChatGPT directly to your clipboard. I say raw text, but it actually uses markdown style code blocks to delineate each chat in the conversation.

## Installation:
To install the extension, follow these steps:

- Download the extension files to your local machine.
- Open Firefox and type about:debugging in the address bar.
- Click on the "This Firefox" tab.
- Click on the "Load Temporary Add-on" button.
- Select the manifest.json file from the extension files.

The extension will now be installed in Firefox and ready to use.

Alternatively, grab the extension from the Firefox extensions market:

## Usage:
To use the extension, follow these steps:

- With a ChatGPT tab open (chat.openai.com, not the API)
- Click on the extension's icon in the Firefox toolbar to open the popup window.
- Click on the "Find and copy" button.
- The conversation will be formatted and copied to the user's clipboard.
- The status of the operation will be displayed in the popup window.

## TODO:
- Code review & optimization
- Improve plugin 'popup' html with styling, formatting, and general UX 
- Improve output formatting

## File Descriptions:

### content_script.js:
This file contains the code that runs in the context of the web page that the user is currently viewing. It listens for messages from the extension and searches for elements in the page that match a specific selector. It then generates a conversation from the text content of those elements and copies it to the user's clipboard.

### manifest.json:
This file is a configuration file that provides important information about the extension to the browser. It specifies the name, version, and description of the extension, as well as the permissions it requires and the code that will run in the context of the web page and the popup window.

### popup.html:
This file defines the user interface for the extension's popup window, which is displayed when the user clicks on the browser action button. It includes a button that the user can click to trigger the extension's functionality and a paragraph element that displays the status of the operation.

### popup.js:
This file contains the code that runs in the context of the extension's popup window. It listens for a click event on the button and sends a message to the content script to trigger the extension's functionality. It also listens for messages from the content script and updates the status of the operation in the popup window.
